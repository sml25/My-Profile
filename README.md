## Interest in IT

**What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).** 

I have no experience in IT but over the last 13 years of my work life I have worked very close with IT, product and development teams with onboarding, migration, upgrades and deployments. Currently, I am account manager that deals with the client facing aspect of various IT financing solutions, and the trigger that sparked my interest in IT was that I want to also be able to do the technical side myself and not want to ask or have IT explain or action on the situation or provide the resolution. 

The technical IT side of the business interests me and I would like to one day work in IT technical related positions. 

Using end user feedback to deliver value added customized analysis through improved UI experience. Also by understanding current work flow processes and the pain points to resolve issues, develop and to grow a product.

I would like to learn IT environments, the actions and processes required to construct IT systems and how to maintain, improve and fix issues. 

I believe this course will provide me with the knowledge across the broad spectrum of the IT industry and to expand my career choices in the future.

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?** 

I am Australian and work full time in HK. I decided to take on a course this year that is credited for an undergraduate degree and researched various sites locally and internationally. 

I found the Online University Australia (OUA) site and it was very easy to use and the universities are very familiar to me as I grew up in Australia. The Undergraduate Information Technology course at RMIT suited my situation as I need a flexible 100 percent online course, especially there is a few hours' time difference with HK and I work fulltime. I am also able to sit my sit the exams in HK as an option, which is great. The application and payment was seamless as I went through OUA online and the entire process was easy and quick. 

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?** 

After graduating from the undergraduate Bachelor of Information Technology course I expect to have learnt the skills and knowledge on IT infrastructure, environments, process and delivery of developing, maintaining and growing a solution. I would also like to know more about the specialized diverse fields of IT on big data, AI, automation, corporate, banking finance solutions through to corporate and personal use e.g. APPs and gaming etc. Ultimately, I would like to be specialized in an area of IT and be able to work in IT related role in the future.
